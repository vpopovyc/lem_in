**Lem-in**

Project was written on **C** implementing **Depth-First Search** (stack version) and **Bread-First Search** (recursive version).

Project description tells that, I need move my ant colony from one point to another in the least amount of time. Through this project, I need to explore graph traversal algorithms: my program choosing the most efficient paths and moves to be taken by the ants.

[DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) – starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

[BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) – explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

**Howto**

Build binary **lemin** and pass arguments to stdin
		
   	$> make all

Erase binaries
		
   	$> make fclean
